# Stage 2 Report

## General information 

- The general topic of the quantitative report is self-regulated learning. 

- The deadline is **`r stage2_due`**.

- This assessment is worth 50% of your final course grade. 

- You should submit a single Word document (.docx) to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link will open no later than 5 working days before the deadline and will be found in the Assignment Submission section of the RM1 Moodle Page.

## Word count and formatting

- The maximum word count for the report is 3000 words. This includes all aspects of the report with the exception of the title, the references, page numbers, and any appendix. All other writing including figure legends, text in figures, in-text citations, etc do count as part of the word limit. There is no 10% rule, 3000 words is a strict upper limit.

- Your work should be presented in a sans-serif font, e.g. Arial or Calibri, 12-point font, double-spaced with 1-inch (2.54cm) margins.

- Your report should be written and formatted according to APA guidelines, though there is no need for a running head.

## Type of assessment/structure

- The report will be a full scientific report (title, abstract, introduction, method, results, discussion, references, appendix). 

- The method section should use appropriate sub-headings (e.g. participants, design, materials, procedure). You may use sub-headings in the introduction, results and discussion if you think they improve clarity, but they are not necessary. 

- You should include the pre-registration in the appendix so that your marker can check it against your results section, however, this will not be marked as it will already have been assessed. 

- You should expect a much higher level of Turnitin overlap for this assessment because of the inclusion of the pre-registration and because method and results sections tend to be more formulaic in how you write them up. Remember, what matters is *what* overlaps, not how much. 

## Assessment Criteria

- Quality of the Knowledge and Research

    - Demonstrate theoretical knowledge by providing a detailed evidence-based understanding of the topic of the report.

    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by correctly reporting the design, materials, and procedure of the study in the method section.

    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by correctly reporting and interpreting the results

- Quality of the Evaluation

    - Use and show academic evidence to support all arguments and discussion.

    - Evaluate the current literature to provide a clear, evidence-based rationale for your hypothesis.

    - Evaluate your study and how your results fit into the wider literature.

- Quality of the Academic Communication

    - Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling and grammar.

    - Reference all sources and report all information in line with APA guidelines.

    - Ensure that all parts of the report have a logical structure, e.g., a broad-to-narrow scope in the introduction, the method section should be organized into appropriate subheadings, the results should present descriptive statistics before inferential statistics, and the discussion should mirror the introduction.

## Assessment support

- Guidance on how to write a psychology report and how to do APA referencing form part of the weekly course activities. You should consult the resources provided throughout the course to help you write your quantitative report.

 - Further information about marking criteria and feedback is available in the [Feedback Information Sheet chapter](#FIS).

- Additional writing and study advice, including 1-to-1 guidance is available via the [Student Learning Development (SLD) website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/).

## How to do well in this assessment

- Meet each of the assessment criteria - use these as a checklist for your work.

- Allow time to proof-read your work before submission.

- Read peer-reviewed journal articles, these will help guide your tone and help you develop your academic writing. Remember that you can read anything for content and style. These are different mindsets when reading so go into your reading with a given purpose  - what do I want to get from this paper? - and that will help use your time more efficiently.

- Write clearly, concisely, with a professional academic tone and logical structure.

- Avoid using quotations. Rephrasing the writing in your own words and with appropriate citation is much more effective in conveying information

- Provide an evidence-based rationale for the project.

- Provide detailed but concise information about the dataset, method and procedures.

- Concisely and accurately report and interpret descriptive statistics, assumptions tests, and inferential statistics. Note any deviations from the pre-registration.

- Present appropriate visualisations for the analyses that you conduct. 

- Interpret the results of the project in the context of the wider literature

- Demonstrate evidence of evaluation, both of the wider literature and of the current project.

- Provide a concise conclusion and an overall summary that covers each section of the report in the form of an abstract.

- Adhere to APA conventions for referencing, formatting, and the reporting of results.

## Common mistakes

- Writing that contains grammatical errors, a lack of clarity, or an informal tone. Reading published articles in comparison to scientific blogs or newspapers will greatly help get the correct tone - key is to focus on how they are writing and phrasing differently across different media.

- Basing the rationale for the report upon personal opinion or “common knowledge” rather than peer-reviewed evidence.

- Missing detail and/or unnecessary detail in the method and result sections.

- Failure to report the results of statistical tests according to APA convention.

- Failure to provide necessary visualisations or the inclusion of unnecessary visualisations. You do not need to provide visualisations for the assumption tests in the main report (although you can include these in the appendix if you wish)

- A lack of evaluation of the wider literature and the current project and/or a discussion of the limitations that is not supported by evidence. 

- Failure to adhere to the word limit - avoid trying to cheat the word limit by improper formatting of citations etc. Part of the skill development is writing concisely.

## How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?

- The quantitative project assesses your ability to apply the concepts that you have learned about during the lectures. This includes the application of pre-registration, methodology and research design, and statistics. 

- Depending on the exact topic you choose, the project may also be related to content from your lectures on memory, learning, social psychology, and mental health and wellbeing. 

## Why am I being assessed like this?

- Scientific reports are the cornerstone of psychological research and learning to write one helps develop your ability to write scientifically, to evaluate research, and your knowledge of statistical concepts. 

- The quantitative project will help you with your RM2 project, dissertation, and with any other written research-focused work you may conduct in the future.

## How does this relate to previous work I have completed?

- You can gain informal feedback by talking to your lab tutor, by attending student office hours, by asking questions on TEAMS, and by discussing papers you have read with peers and/or staff. 

- Feedback from your pre-registration may help you with the discussion to identify limitations and with the use of technical terminology.

- Feedback on any written assignment will help with academic communication.
