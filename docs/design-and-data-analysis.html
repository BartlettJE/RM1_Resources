<p>This subsection usually comes last in the method because it is now leading the reader into the results. It is the transition point between how the study was run and what you used into how you plan on analysing the data. It is not about the procedure as it is not about what your participants saw or did, it is about what <strong>you</strong> plan on doing with the data.</p>
<p>Thinking about logical flow again, if you were to present this at the start of the method section, then it would not make much sense to the reader as they just do not know enough information about the study yet.</p>
<p>You would normally include aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify the research design of your study</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is it within-subjects, between-subjects, correlational?</p></li>
<li><p>If you have more than one analysis in your study, you must remember to discuss and present both - either as one paragraph or two separate paragraphs.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the dependent/measured variables</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are planning a t-test then it would be better to talk about your dependent variable</p></li>
<li><p>If you are planning a correlation, then it would be better to talk about measured variables as there is no independent and dependent variable in a correlational design.</p></li>
<li><p>Be precise: you are testing the mean or sum score on a subscale of the MSLQ, it is not just e.g., self-efficacy as an abstract concept.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the independent variable and its conditions/levels (levels is just another name for conditions or groups), if you have one (i.e., those using a t-test)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can clarify it is a quasi-experimental variable.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "In our study, we have an independent variable of level of study with two levels: postgraduate and undergraduate.</p></li>
<li><p>Your levels will potentially link back to information in the participants section if you have an independent variable. Remember though: if you have a correlational design, you probably will not have one.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, you could report a power analysis here to outline how many participants you estimate you need to detect your smallest effect size of interest. Alternatively, you could report it at the start of your results section. If you and your group do attempt a power analysis, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will want to state and justify the alpha value, the power value, and the smallest effect size of interest. Typically, you will be calculating the sample size as the output here.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "Previous research (Paterson &amp; Robertson, 2014; Swingler &amp; Toivo, 2019; Toivo &amp; Swingler, 2020) found small- to medium-sized correlations in related studies looking at test anxiety and help-seeking. As such, using the field standard of alpha = .05, power = .80, and a smallest effect size of interest of <em>r</em> = .3 (Swingler &amp; Toivo, 2019), we require 35 participants.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Briefly state how you plan on analysing the data</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You would state the type of test, use of R (with citations), and any relevant packages.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea here is to constrain those researcher degrees of freedom, so you are outlining how you plan on analysing the data to the best of your knowledge, so you can explain and justify any deviations from this plan in your stage two individual report.</p></li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Methods sections are formulaic and work by putting the right information in the right sections. Try to follow the guidance above on what goes where.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>must</strong> use sub-headings and we would highly recommend the sub-headings we have stated here.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid repeating information across sections. If you find you are doing that, then it is likely that you are including information in the wrong sections. Each section has a different focus.</p></li>
<li><p>Be concise but detailed. Try not to waste words in the method section and state things clearly. Save words for building your narrative in the introduction and discussion sections. Its a balancing act as your method section should also be detailed enough to allow someone to replicate your study.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading journal articles and focusing on the method section is a good way to see what information can go where. There is a lot of variation in published articles though and they are not often replicable, so another thing to think about when reading papers is "what is missing here that would allow me to replicate this study?".</p></li>
<li><p>Read the ILOs in the Assessment Information Sheet (AIS) for aspects about demonstrating technical knowledge of the different parts, for writing clearly and succinctly, and for professional communication and organisation.</p></li>

<p>Here, we are going to look at a procedure section and a material section from a couple of papers to help drive home some of the ideas we have discussed above. Try to think about the questions and pointers were are raising here when you look at your material and procedure sections, but also your participants and design and data analysis sections.</p>

<p>This is the Procedure section from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0301006616643675">Tsantani et al. (2016)</a>. Given that it is published, it would be considered good. However, there are also aspects that could be improved. Read the paragraph then look at the highlighted sections after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The experiment took place in the experimental laboratories of the University of Glasgow. Participants were required to complete a 2AFC task during which they listened to pairs of voices comprising high- and low-pitched versions of the original recordings. The sound samples were presented through headphones (participants' own) connected to a computer with the sound set at approximately 80 dB Sound Pressure Level (SPL): System volume was measured prior to the experiment using a standard headphone set (Sennheisser Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 250 OHM) and sound meter. At the beginning of the experiment, participants were informed, via on-screen instructions, that they would hear pairs of voices in two blocks, by trait, and would be asked to make a decision regarding each pair. Participants were told that there was no time limit to their decision but were encouraged to answer with their first impression. After each pair of voices the question "Which voice did you perceive as more {dominant} {trustworthy}?" was displayed on the screen. Pressing the "s" key would mean that they perceived Voice 1 as being most dominant or trustworthy, whereas the "k" key represented Voice 2. The definitions of dominance and trustworthiness used in the instructions were "Dominance means having power and influence over others" and "Trustworthiness means able to be relied on as honest or truthful." The order of the dominance and trustworthiness blocks, as well as the order in which the voice trials were presented within the block, were counterbalanced across participants. Male and female trials were presented randomly within the same block, as opposed to being presented in different blocks, to avoid an additional potential block-order effect caused by the gender of the voice. Finally, the order of the high- and low-pitched versions of the recordings within each trial was counterbalanced by including two trials of each pair in a block, with the high- and low-pitched versions in a different order. Therefore, within each block, the 20 pairs of voice samples were presented twice. The voices within each pair were played consecutively with a 1-s pause between the first voice and the second voice, and participants proceeded to the next trial by pressing "space." The experiment lasted approximately 14 min."</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is clear on which keys participants were told to use. This is quite specific detail, but clearly the authors had a reason for this. Normally, this will be because it helps reduce reaction times if specific keys are used and participants hold their fingers on those keys at all times.</p></li>
<li><p>However, what is not stated is whether participants were told to always have fingers on those keys and whether this "key-mapping" (what key represents what answer) was shown all the time to participants, just at the start, or just at breaks?</p></li>

<p>This is adapted from the materials section of a first draft of a paper by Stuart McLaren and Phil McAleer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985) consists of 51 items comprised of two sections and six subscales. The first section includes 23 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from "1 = No Anxiety" to "5 = Strong Anxiety". This section addresses three factors related to how individuals experience specific statistical situations: (a) Test and Class Anxiety (8-items with scores that range from 8 to 40), (b) Interpretation Anxiety (11-items with scores that range from 11 to 55) and (c) Fear of Asking for Help (4-items with scores that range from 4 to 20). For instance, statements include "Doing an examination for a statistics course" or "Going to ask my statistics teacher for individual help with material I am having difficulty in understanding". The second section consists of 28 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from "1 = Strongly Disagree" to "5 = Strongly Agree". This section examines levels of attitudes towards scenarios that involve statistics and statistics teachers over three factors: (d) Worth of Statistics (16-items with scores that range from 16 to 80), (e) Fear of Statistic Teachers (5-items with scores that range from 5 to 25), and (f) Computational Self-Concept (7-items with scores that range from 7 to 35). For example, statements include "I wish the statistics requirement would be removed from my academic program" or "Statisticians are more number orientated than they are people orientated". A compound score of each subscale is calculated by summing item scores in each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of statistics anxiety. The six subscales show good Cronbach's alpha reliabilities between .81 and .94 (Chew et al., 2018)."</p>

<li>This works here, but it could also appear in the data analysis subsection.

<ul>
<li>Finally, we have not explored reliability of scales in much detail (briefly in lecture 2) but if you had that information from a previous paper, then it can be useful and helps give context to the scales to show they are valid and reliable. The one thing maybe here that is missing is just stating what these values mean: for example, do they mean high reliability or low reliability?
