<p>Before you can read journal articles, you need to find them. The first step in a literature review is working out what your keywords will be. You will be looking in data bases, so you need to select the appropriate terms to ensure your search results return the content you are looking for. It takes patience to identify and tweak the search terms that identify the content you are looking for. As a starting point, these might be your topic or variables.</p>
<p>Once you identify some useful articles, these can provide further inspiration and specificity. Many journal articles will give you a helping hand as the authors have to provide several keywords relating to the article. For example, the following figure from <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615572906">Schroeder and Epley (2015)</a> highlights the keywords that describe their article.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-keywords.png" title="Screenshot of first page of Schroeder and Epley showing title, abstract, and keywords." alt="Screenshot of first page of Schroeder and Epley showing title, abstract, and keywords." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>The majority of articles will post keywords under the abstract. Here, we can see there are seven words or short phrases that summarise the content of the article. Sometimes they are not truly relevant to the topic (e.g., open data here), so you will need to skim a few articles to recognise recurring themes and potentially useful keywords.</p>
</div>
<div id="search-strategies" class="section level3" number="16.1.2">

<span class="header-section-number">16.1.2</span> Search strategies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#search-strategies"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Once you have some keywords, your next step will be to try and find more articles. The two main data bases you will use are the University of Glasgow library and Google Scholar.</p>
<p>The University of Glasgow library can be accessed through your student portal. This is the database that the university uses to pay for access to journal articles and ebooks. Glasgow has a huge number of journals available, so this will be one of your best resources as you may be asked to pay for articles if you access journal websites directly, never pay for articles though, there is always a way to find them. Google Scholar is also a valuable resource that can return different results. A combination of these two databases will be a good starting point for any essay or report.</p>
<div class="dangerous">
<p>Never pay for journal articles. We have a huge library at Glasgow, so you will almost always find the article by searching for the title. If it is not available, then there are other strategies like searching the title on Google Scholar or regular Google and there might be a PDF someone has posted. Authors can often freely share an author manuscript which contains the same text as the final article but without the fancy journal formatting.</p>
</div>
<p>Enter your keywords in the search bar of these data bases. You can enter one word or phrase and the data base will try to locate resources that contain that word. For example, we might want to find additional articles investigating job candidates' speech.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-single-keyword.png" title="Screenshot of the University of Glasgow library page to search for articles featuring job candidate speech." alt="Screenshot of the University of Glasgow library page to search for articles featuring job candidate speech." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>However, it is usually much more powerful to combine search terms to provide more precise results. If you enter single words or phrases, you might find there are thousands of results which contain mostly irrelevant articles. You can use two or more keywords to look for more specific articles.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-multiple-keywords.png" title="Screenshot of the University of Glasgow library page to search for articles using AND as a Boolean operator." alt="Screenshot of the University of Glasgow library page to search for articles using AND as a Boolean operator." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Here, you can see we have used speech AND decision making AND hiring. The capitalised AND is called a <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/fulltextjournalarticles/searchforarticles/">Boolean operator</a>. It is used to link together the three words. It means we only want articles that contain the three words. Not one of them, not two of them, but all three. Using AND narrows down your search. Alternatively, you can use OR which expands your search to look for two or more terms. AND will provide fewer results and OR will provide more. You can also use NOT to rule out particular terms.</p>
<div class="info">
<p>You can do this in the single search bar by entering the Boolean operators yourself. Alternatively, if you click advanced search, you can add search boxes and choose from AND, OR, and NOT for each term. You can also start to filter your results to only return results from a date range, if you only wanted articles from say the past 5 years.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://southern.libguides.com/google/boolean">Boolean operators in Google Scholar</a> to combine the search terms gender AND “hiring decisions”. This means we only want search results that contain both elements.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-scholar-search.png" title="Screenshot of using Boolean operators in Google Scholar." alt="Screenshot of using Boolean operators in Google Scholar." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Hiring decisions is also surrounded by quotes. This forces databases to search for the specific phrase exactly as typed in the quotes. If we did not surround it by quotes, we can get search results that contain the words hiring and decisions separately or together. If they are separate, the results might not be quite what we are looking for.</p>
<p>As a final literature searching tip, once you find an article that is precisely on the topic you are searching for, you can look at articles in its reference list, and at articles that have since cited it. This is no guarantee there will be something useful, but you can often benefit from the citation trees of your key articles.</p>
<p>On the library portal, you can see articles that your target articles cites, which will show the articles in its reference list that are readable by the library data base.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-cites.png" title="Screenshot of identifying articles that a target article cites in the library portal." alt="Screenshot of identifying articles that a target article cites in the library portal." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Alternatively, on Google Scholar, you can look through the articles that have since cited your target article. You will get fewer hits for more recent articles as there has been less time for another article to be published, but its another useful strategy for identifying potentially useful articles.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-Scholar-cited.png" title="Screenshot of identifying articles that have since cited your target article in Google Scholar." alt="Screenshot of identifying articles that have since cited your target article in Google Scholar." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>

<p>Throughout the programme, you will need to use APA 7th edition. Although you could download each article and manually enter the citation and reference list entries, there are more efficient ways to provide you with more time in other areas of your report or essay writing. A reference manager will help to keep your research organised and it will do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to entering citations and creating the reference list.</p>
<p>Our recommendation is Zotero which can be downloaded for free at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" class="uri">https://www.zotero.org/</a>. There are alternatives (such as EndNote which the university endorses as approved software), but most of the psychology team prefer Zotero. Under preferences, make sure you select APA 7th edition to format the citations and references correctly.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/02-Zotero.png" title="Zotero logo with red Z and black otero." alt="Zotero logo with red Z and black otero." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<div class="warning">
<p>As third-party software which requires you to create an account, we recommend not using the same password as your university account.</p>
</div>
<p>Using Zotero, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install a plugin to save articles you find through your web browser</p></li>
<li><p>If there is an open access version of the article PDF, Zotero will automatically save it</p></li>
<li><p>Manually upload PDFs and Zotero will try to find the key metadata such as the title, volume number etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Create folders to keep your research organised into folders, such as one for each assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Create shared folders to add and access the same articles with people you are working with.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy citation and reference lists into your assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Zotero plugin in Word or Google Docs to enter citations and automatically create a reference list.</p></li>
<li><p>Add notes and highlights to each article you read within Zotero.</p></li>
<li><p>Sync your library across devices, so you can download articles on your laptop, but read the articles on your tablet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Just keep in mind, Zotero cannot always find all the information or it gets some of the details wrong. So, you may have to manually enter/edit the details for the citation/reference to be formatted correctly. This is why it is still important to learn the key details of APA formatting, but you are using your understanding more efficiently to spot mistakes rather than manually format each entry in your assignment.</p>
<p>If you like to follow along to a video, there are some helpful resources on YouTube to guide you through a lot of the basics:</p>

<li><p>There are also <a href="https://youtu.be/JG7Uq_JFDzE?si=S973FkGPMNgXyYkh">longer tutorials working through the features</a> of Zotero.</p></li>

<span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Reading journal articles<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reading-journal-articles"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Now you have one or two articles, the ability to read them might sound obvious, but research (e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11251-018-9456-2">Kershaw et al., 2018</a>) consistently shows students find it difficult at first to summarise and critically evaluate empirical research. Our students have a range of backgrounds, so we want to make sure everyone has the skills to read and evaluate published research.</p>
<p>Journal articles have a different structure and writing style than textbooks or news articles. Usually, they are not written to be a thrilling bedtime read. They can be quite dense with lots of technical jargon. This means - particularly early in your degree - you have to be quite strategic in how you read journal articles.</p>
<p>Until you learn about different statistical tests, the introduction and discussion sections will be most accessible. The introduction provides the background to the study and outlines what the study is trying to achieve. The discussion recaps what results the authors think they found and puts them in context. As you progress through your research methods courses, you will understand more of the method and results.</p>

</h3>
<p>Before we introduce the QALMRI method, it is important you recognise there are different types of journal article. The QALMRI method mainly applies to original quantitative research, so here is a list of common journal articles and types of research you may come across:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Original research: quantitative studies</strong>: Potentially the most common type of research in psychology. These articles contain an individual study or a series of studies where the researchers collect numeric data to answer their research question. This is what we will focus on for this tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Original research: qualitative studies</strong>: Some research follows a different methodological philosophy where they collect non-numerical data, such as identifying themes in forum posts. The QALMRI method would not totally apply here as qualitative research typically does not test hypotheses, but you would identify the authors' broad and specific research questions and their important results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses</strong>: Researchers may want to identify all the relevant articles on a topic and collate their findings. In a systematic review, the authors provide an overview of the findings in words. In a meta-analysis, the authors apply statistical techniques to calculate the average effect size across studies and how much the effect sizes vary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review article</strong>: Instead of trying to identify all relevant articles in a systematic review, a review is less comprehensive. Researchers typically write review articles to explain a topic to readers or outline a theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Editorials</strong>: Editors of a journal may write short introductions to a collection of articles they are publishing or announce a new policy for their journal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commentary or opinion articles</strong>: Commentary or opinion articles allow authors to present their viewpoint on a topic, typically in response to another article. For example, if a set of authors disagree with the methods or interpretation of an original article, they can write a commentary or opinion article to explain why they disagree.</p></li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>One evidenced-based strategy to learn how to read journal articles containing original quantitative research is known as the QALMRI (Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inferences) method (<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/p39sc/">Brosowsky et al., 2020</a>). You can read more about the method on <a href="https://www.crumplab.com/ResearchMethodsLab/qalmri.html">Crump's (2018)</a> Research Methods Lab Manual. When reading an article, try and answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What was the broad question (the general topic of interest) being asked by this research project?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the specific question (what this specific experiment will address) being asked by this research project?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What was the author’s hypothesis (the hypothesis they are testing)?</p></li>
<li><p>What were the alternative hypotheses (what other explanations could there be that the authors ruled out)?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Logic</strong></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What was the logic of the hypothesis? i.e., if the hypothesis was true, what should we expect to happen?</li>

<li><p>Briefly describe the study design (i.e., experimental or correlational?) and sample.</p></li>
<li><p>What were the variables? i.e., independent and dependent variables for experiments; variables for correlations.</p></li>
<li><p>Briefly describe the study procedure in everyday terms.</p></li>
</ol>

The following answers are reproduced from Brosowsky and Parshina with some minor edits. They evaluated the study "Ecological validity of the testing effect: The use of daily quizzes in introductory Psychology" by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628316677492">Batsell et al.

<p><strong>The authors conclude that they successfully replicated the testing effect, previously shown in laboratory settings, in a naturalistic classroom setting.

<p><strong>These results are consistent with the original hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) and suggest that periodic quizzes can enhance the retention of assigned material (specific question) and testing could be used as an effective teaching technique to improve student learning in a classroom setting (big question).</strong></p>

</h3>
<p>Now you have read about the QALMRI method and saw how you can answer the 11 questions based on the information in a journal article, it is time to practice yourself on a new article.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00101/full">Pieger et al. (2018)</a> is available open access through the journal <em>Frontiers in Education</em>. They studied the disfluency effect: the idea that writing information in a harder to read font requires greater concentration which can lead to improved recall when quizzed on the topic. Read through the article and try to answer the questions from the QALMRI method. The activity below is based on downloading the article as a PDF to see page numbers, but you could check your understanding of the QALMRI questions using either the web or PDF version.</p>
<p>Each question has two elements: the page number that includes the information and a hidden solution providing a longer explanation. Make sure you attempt each question on your own first and then check you identified the correct information by looking at the solution. For the page number, you can keep track of how many you answered correct below:</p>

For example, rating how confident they were about their performance. Then the participants studied the text for up to 15 minutes and completed the second monitoring judgments.

<p>On the top and middle of page 7, the authors recap their results at the start of the discussion.

<p>Each row can be one article you read and you can group each section of the QALMRI method as separate columns. As you build your literature review, you can see similarities and differences across the studies. You also have prompts for critical evaluation where you can comment on features like the sample and sample size. Organising your notes like this will help you stay organised as its unlikely you will remember every key feature of the 10th or 20th article.</p>
<p>In addition, you might find these blog posts by Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega - a political scientist - helpful when thinking about how you can approach a literature review and keep your reading organised:</p>

<p>Like any skill, learning how to recognise the key information in journal articles takes time and practice. Journal articles are typically written for expert audiences, so they may not specifically label key information you are looking for. For example, in the exercise above, Pieger et al. did not say they used a 2x2 mixed design. You had to recognise the information in the main text and piece it together. As you read more journal articles, you will get quicker at recognising this information, allowing you to focus more time on reading the article critically than simply understanding it.</p>
<p>If you would like additional tips and resources on reading journal articles, you might find the following articles useful:</p>
