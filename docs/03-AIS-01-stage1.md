# Stage 1 Report

## General information

- The pre-registration sets out your plans and code for your quantitative project analyses.

 - The deadline is **December 1st 2023**.

- This assessment is worth 30% of your final course grade and will be a group mark.

- One member of your group should submit a) your pre-reg .Rmd file, b) a knitted Word document of your pre-reg file, and c) a copy of the data to Moodle.

- The submission link will open no later than 5 working days before the deadline and will be found in the Assignment Submission section of Moodle.

- To ensure all members of the group contribute equally, you will be asked to provide a peer rating which may be used to adjust the individual grade awarded (more details to follow during semester).

## Word count and formatting

- This includes all text within your responses to five questions at the start of the pre-registration form including in-text citations. However, it does not include the references or your analysis code, or the text of the questions in the template.

 - Please not that there is no 10% rule, 1000 words is a strict upper limit.

 - You do not need to apply any formatting to the .Rmd file or the knitted Word document. You can if you choose, however, this is not a requirement and the default formatting of the knitted file will suffice.

 - All citations and references should follow APA guidelines although you do not need to indent the reference list (because this is very difficult to do in Markdown).
 
## Type of assessment/structure

- The pre-registration should answer all specified questions about your intended analysis and should also provide the analysis code based on the pilot data.

- You should complete the pre-registration .Rmd template available on Moodle. You should include the text of the questions/headings in your submission.

- Your code should be reproducible, that is, your marker should be able to click "Knit" and your pre-registration code should fully compile using the data and code provided.

 - We also ask you to submit a copy of the knitted Word document so that in the event your .Rmd file is not reproducible and cannot be knitted, the rest of your work can still be marked.

- You will likely have a reference list which should come at the end of the pre-registration and will not be included in the word count.

## Assessment Criteria

- Quality of the Knowledge and Research
    - Demonstrate theoretical knowledge by providing a concise evidence-based rationale for the hypothesis/design.
    
    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by providing appropriate answers to all questions, informed by knowledge from the wider course.
    
- Quality of the Evaluation

    - Clearly explain/justify all decisions made in the pre-registration where relevant.

    - Use academic evidence to support your decisions and ideas where relevant.

Quality of the Academic Communication

    - Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling, and grammar.

    - Provide a reproducible document that can be knitted without any errors.

## Assessment support

- Guidance on how to complete the pre-registration will form part of the weekly course activities. 

- The assumptions of correlations and t-tests and how to choose which type of test is covered in the lectures and associated reading and the relevant sections of the PsyTeachR Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book.

 - The code you need to conduct your analysis is explained in the [PsyTeachR Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/index.html).

- Further information about assessment criteria and feedback can be found in the [Feedback Information Sheet](#FIS) chapter.

- You can find additional writing and study advice, including 1-to-1 guidance on the [Student Learning Development (SLD) website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/).

## How to do well in this assessment

- Meet each of the assessment criteria - use these as a checklist for your work.

- Knit your document frequently when working on the code to avoid any errors.

- Allow time to proof-read your work before submission.

- Answer all questions and all parts of each question.

- Provide a **concise** evidence-based rationale for your hypothesis.

- Use the available materials to ensure the accuracy of your decisions.

- Explain your decisions and support them with evidence. Note that there are often multiple decisions you can make and there is not one “right” answer – this is absolutely fine, what matters is that you can explain and support your decisions and it is the sophistication of these explanations that is important.

## Common mistakes

- Failure to provide a reproducible document.

- Not explaining the decisions that you make and not using evidence to support them.

- Writing too much on the rationale for the hypothesis and not providing enough detail for the other questions - remember this is not supposed to be the introduction of a report, it's just a short summary of your motivation for the ensuing analysis.

- Writing that is unclear and/or imprecise.

- Inaccuracies in the explanation or reporting of methodological and statistical information.

- Failure to adhere to the word limit.

## How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?

The pre-registration allows you the opportunity to apply many of the concepts you have learned in the available material by making analytical decisions based upon your knowledge of statistics and research design.

## Why am I being assessed like this?

- Pre-registration is becoming increasingly common in psychological research and it is a process that will serve you well should you continue with research as it demonstrates a commitment to open and reproducible science.

- The pre-registration allows you to think through the steps of the analysis and therefore will help support the quantitative project.

- The pre-registration is a group submission to reflect the fact that in most research, these decisions will be made as a team and it allows you to pool your collective knowledge to design the best study possible.

## How does this relate to previous work I have completed?

- You can gain informal feedback by talking to your lab tutor, statistics lecturers, and/or by attending student office hours.

- Feedback on any previous written assignment will help with academic communication and using evidence to support your arguments.

- Feedback on your data skills assignments will be useful for the coding aspect of the pre-registration.
