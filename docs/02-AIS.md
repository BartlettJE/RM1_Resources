## Stage 1 Report

### General information

- The pre-registration sets out your plans and code for your quantitative project analyses.

 - The deadline is **December 1st 2023**.

- This assessment is worth 30% of your final course grade and will be a group mark.

- One member of your group should submit a) your pre-reg .Rmd file, b) a knitted Word document of your pre-reg file, and c) a copy of the data to Moodle.

- The submission link will open no later than 5 working days before the deadline and will be found in the Assignment Submission section of Moodle.

- To ensure all members of the group contribute equally, you will be asked to provide a peer rating which may be used to adjust the individual grade awarded (more details to follow during semester).

### Word count and formatting

- This includes all text within your responses to five questions at the start of the pre-registration form including in-text citations. However, it does not include the references or your analysis code, or the text of the questions in the template.

 - Please not that there is no 10% rule, 1000 words is a strict upper limit.

 - You do not need to apply any formatting to the .Rmd file or the knitted Word document. You can if you choose, however, this is not a requirement and the default formatting of the knitted file will suffice.

 - All citations and references should follow APA guidelines although you do not need to indent the reference list (because this is very difficult to do in Markdown).
 
### Type of assessment/structure

- The pre-registration should answer all specified questions about your intended analysis and should also provide the analysis code based on the pilot data.

- You should complete the pre-registration .Rmd template available on Moodle. You should include the text of the questions/headings in your submission.

- Your code should be reproducible, that is, your marker should be able to click "Knit" and your pre-registration code should fully compile using the data and code provided.

 - We also ask you to submit a copy of the knitted Word document so that in the event your .Rmd file is not reproducible and cannot be knitted, the rest of your work can still be marked.

- You will likely have a reference list which should come at the end of the pre-registration and will not be included in the word count.

### Assessment Criteria

- Quality of the Knowledge and Research
    - Demonstrate theoretical knowledge by providing a concise evidence-based rationale for the hypothesis/design.
    
    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by providing appropriate answers to all questions, informed by knowledge from the wider course.
    
- Quality of the Evaluation

    - Clearly explain/justify all decisions made in the pre-registration where relevant.

    - Use academic evidence to support your decisions and ideas where relevant.

Quality of the Academic Communication

    - Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling, and grammar.

    - Provide a reproducible document that can be knitted without any errors.

### Assessment support

- Guidance on how to complete the pre-registration will form part of the weekly course activities. 

- The assumptions of correlations and t-tests and how to choose which type of test is covered in the lectures and associated reading and the relevant sections of the PsyTeachR Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book.

 - The code you need to conduct your analysis is explained in the [PsyTeachR Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/index.html).

- Further information about assessment criteria and feedback can be found in the [Feedback Information Sheet](#FIS) chapter.

- You can find additional writing and study advice, including 1-to-1 guidance on the [Student Learning Development (SLD) website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/).

### How to do well in this assessment

- Meet each of the assessment criteria - use these as a checklist for your work.

- Knit your document frequently when working on the code to avoid any errors.

- Allow time to proof-read your work before submission.

- Answer all questions and all parts of each question.

- Provide a **concise** evidence-based rationale for your hypothesis.

- Use the available materials to ensure the accuracy of your decisions.

- Explain your decisions and support them with evidence. Note that there are often multiple decisions you can make and there is not one “right” answer – this is absolutely fine, what matters is that you can explain and support your decisions and it is the sophistication of these explanations that is important.

### Common mistakes

- Failure to provide a reproducible document.

- Not explaining the decisions that you make and not using evidence to support them.

- Writing too much on the rationale for the hypothesis and not providing enough detail for the other questions - remember this is not supposed to be the introduction of a report, it's just a short summary of your motivation for the ensuing analysis.

- Writing that is unclear and/or imprecise.

- Inaccuracies in the explanation or reporting of methodological and statistical information.

- Failure to adhere to the word limit.

### How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?

The pre-registration allows you the opportunity to apply many of the concepts you have learned in the available material by making analytical decisions based upon your knowledge of statistics and research design.

### Why am I being assessed like this?

- Pre-registration is becoming increasingly common in psychological research and it is a process that will serve you well should you continue with research as it demonstrates a commitment to open and reproducible science.

- The pre-registration allows you to think through the steps of the analysis and therefore will help support the quantitative project.

- The pre-registration is a group submission to reflect the fact that in most research, these decisions will be made as a team and it allows you to pool your collective knowledge to design the best study possible.

### How does this relate to previous work I have completed?

- You can gain informal feedback by talking to your lab tutor, statistics lecturers, and/or by attending student office hours.

- Feedback on any previous written assignment will help with academic communication and using evidence to support your arguments.

- Feedback on your data skills assignments will be useful for the coding aspect of the pre-registration.

## Stage 2 Report

### General information 

- The general topic of the quantitative report is self-regulated learning. 

- The deadline is **December 1st 2023**.

- This assessment is worth 50% of your final course grade. 

- You should submit a single Word document (.docx) to Moodle prior to the deadline. The submission link will open no later than 5 working days before the deadline and will be found in the Assignment Submission section of the RM1 Moodle Page.

### Word count and formatting

- The maximum word count for the report is 3000 words. This includes all aspects of the report with the exception of the title, the references, page numbers, and any appendix. All other writing including figure legends, text in figures, in-text citations, etc do count as part of the word limit. There is no 10% rule, 3000 words is a strict upper limit.

- Your work should be presented in a sans-serif font, e.g. Arial or Calibri, 12-point font, double-spaced with 1-inch (2.54cm) margins.

- Your report should be written and formatted according to APA guidelines, though there is no need for a running head.

### Type of assessment/structure

- The report will be a full scientific report (title, abstract, introduction, method, results, discussion, references, appendix). 

- The method section should use appropriate sub-headings (e.g. participants, design, materials, procedure). You may use sub-headings in the introduction, results and discussion if you think they improve clarity, but they are not necessary. 

- You should include the pre-registration in the appendix so that your marker can check it against your results section, however, this will not be marked as it will already have been assessed. 

- You should expect a much higher level of Turnitin overlap for this assessment because of the inclusion of the pre-registration and because method and results sections tend to be more formulaic in how you write them up. Remember, what matters is *what* overlaps, not how much. 

### Assessment Criteria

- Quality of the Knowledge and Research

    - Demonstrate theoretical knowledge by providing a detailed evidence-based understanding of the topic of the report.

    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by correctly reporting the design, materials, and procedure of the study in the method section.

    - Demonstrate technical knowledge by correctly reporting and interpreting the results

- Quality of the Evaluation

    - Use and show academic evidence to support all arguments and discussion.

    - Evaluate the current literature to provide a clear, evidence-based rationale for your hypothesis.

    - Evaluate your study and how your results fit into the wider literature.

- Quality of the Academic Communication

    - Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling and grammar.

    - Reference all sources and report all information in line with APA guidelines.

    - Ensure that all parts of the report have a logical structure, e.g., a broad-to-narrow scope in the introduction, the method section should be organized into appropriate subheadings, the results should present descriptive statistics before inferential statistics, and the discussion should mirror the introduction.

### Assessment support

- Guidance on how to write a psychology report and how to do APA referencing form part of the weekly course activities. You should consult the resources provided throughout the course to help you write your quantitative report.

 - Further information about marking criteria and feedback is available in the [Feedback Information Sheet chapter](#FIS).

- Additional writing and study advice, including 1-to-1 guidance is available via the [Student Learning Development (SLD) website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/).

### How to do well in this assessment

- Meet each of the assessment criteria - use these as a checklist for your work.

- Allow time to proof-read your work before submission.

- Read peer-reviewed journal articles, these will help guide your tone and help you develop your academic writing. Remember that you can read anything for content and style. These are different mindsets when reading so go into your reading with a given purpose  - what do I want to get from this paper? - and that will help use your time more efficiently.

- Write clearly, concisely, with a professional academic tone and logical structure.

- Avoid using quotations. Rephrasing the writing in your own words and with appropriate citation is much more effective in conveying information

- Provide an evidence-based rationale for the project.

- Provide detailed but concise information about the dataset, method and procedures.

- Concisely and accurately report and interpret descriptive statistics, assumptions tests, and inferential statistics. Note any deviations from the pre-registration.

- Present appropriate visualisations for the analyses that you conduct. 

- Interpret the results of the project in the context of the wider literature

- Demonstrate evidence of evaluation, both of the wider literature and of the current project.

- Provide a concise conclusion and an overall summary that covers each section of the report in the form of an abstract.

- Adhere to APA conventions for referencing, formatting, and the reporting of results.

### Common mistakes

- Writing that contains grammatical errors, a lack of clarity, or an informal tone. Reading published articles in comparison to scientific blogs or newspapers will greatly help get the correct tone - key is to focus on how they are writing and phrasing differently across different media.

- Basing the rationale for the report upon personal opinion or “common knowledge” rather than peer-reviewed evidence.

- Missing detail and/or unnecessary detail in the method and result sections.

- Failure to report the results of statistical tests according to APA convention.

- Failure to provide necessary visualisations or the inclusion of unnecessary visualisations. You do not need to provide visualisations for the assumption tests in the main report (although you can include these in the appendix if you wish)

- A lack of evaluation of the wider literature and the current project and/or a discussion of the limitations that is not supported by evidence. 

- Failure to adhere to the word limit - avoid trying to cheat the word limit by improper formatting of citations etc. Part of the skill development is writing concisely.

### How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?

- The quantitative project assesses your ability to apply the concepts that you have learned about during the lectures. This includes the application of pre-registration, methodology and research design, and statistics. 

- Depending on the exact topic you choose, the project may also be related to content from your lectures on memory, learning, social psychology, and mental health and wellbeing. 

### Why am I being assessed like this?

- Scientific reports are the cornerstone of psychological research and learning to write one helps develop your ability to write scientifically, to evaluate research, and your knowledge of statistical concepts. 

- The quantitative project will help you with your RM2 project, dissertation, and with any other written research-focused work you may conduct in the future.

### How does this relate to previous work I have completed?

- You can gain informal feedback by talking to your lab tutor, by attending student office hours, by asking questions on TEAMS, and by discussing papers you have read with peers and/or staff. 

- Feedback from your pre-registration may help you with the discussion to identify limitations and with the use of technical terminology.

- Feedback on any written assignment will help with academic communication. 

## MCQ

### General information

- You are required to answer a set of multiple-choice questions that relate to the course content for RM1. This includes lectures, data skills, labs and academic writing tutorials. 

- In total, this assessment is worth 5% of your final course grade. 

- The deadline for submitting the MCQ is **December 1st 2023**.

### How to do well in this assessment

- Keep up with the course content on a weekly basis.

- Complete the essential reading for each lecture.

### Common mistakes

- Not keeping up with the lecture content and reading.

- Failing to read the question carefully.

- Failing to answer all questions. 

### Why am I being assessed like this?

- Testing your knowledge of the course content helps you actively engage with the material, meaning you will learn more.

- Engaging with the material on the course will help build a strong foundation for the rest of the RM1 course and your subsequent assessments. 

## Data skills

### General information 

- Data Skills Assignment 1 deadline: **December 1st 2023**. Feedback will be returned by December 19th.

- Data Skills Assignment 2 deadline: **December 1st 2023**. Feedback will be returned by December 19th.

- In total, this assessment is worth 15% of your final course grade. Each portfolio submission is worth 7.5% and you will be awarded a mark out of 22.

- There will be separate submission links for each Assignment where you will submit a single .Rmd file to each. You should only submit the .Rmd file.

- The assignment and submission link will be made available one week before the deadline.

### Type of assessment/structure

- Over two data skills assignments we will ask you to complete a series of tasks including general statistical knowledge questions, data wrangling and visualisation tasks, descriptive and inferential statistics tasks, and interpretation questions. Note that this list is indicative and non-exhaustive.

- We will not ask you anything that has not been covered yet in either the lectures or the data skills book.

- Normally there will be approximately 11 questions in each assignment with each question will being worth 1, 2 or 3 marks to sum to the UofG 22 point scale of Schedule A.

### Assessment support

- All the coding tasks you will be asked to do will have been covered in the data skills book, and the activities within the book. Theoretical tasks will have been covered in the lectures, labs, and data skills book. 

- For coding tasks it is important to try the code in the book as you go along and ask questions about what you are doing. This will really help you in the assignments.

- You are free to ask questions regarding the assignment on the available forums, in-class, or in student office hours. However, please do not post answers or code that would be close to giving the answer as this would contravene the University policy on plagiarism. Policies regarding how to use the forums can be found on the main forum pages. If a member of the team needs to see the code you are trying they will ask you for it.

- To avoid confusions: you are allowed to post code when asking questions about a task in the data skills book but you should not post code relating to a question about either of the data skills assignments unless asked to by a member of staff. Again, this is because posting code related to an answer in an assignment could count as plagiarism. 

- When submitting the file make sure that you submit the completed .Rmd file for that lab only. You must include your GUID in the filename, followed by ‘MSc_RM1’ and the Assignment Number. The file that you are given will have most of this information already but when submitted it should read, for example, ‘9804672_MSc_Rm1_Assignment1.Rmd’.

- Please note that these are individual assessments and not groupwork. Whilst we encourage students to work together and learn the skills together, copying and passing each other code and answers by any means will be considered plagiarism and can result in your being reported to Senate.

- Further information about feedback can be found in the [Feedback Information Sheet](#FIS) chapter.

### How to do well in these assignments

- Completing all formative and summative work on the practical data skills. All the assignments build on each other and information within the formative assignments are needed to complete the summative assignments.

- Use the data skills book activities to guide you – in almost all cases the answers to the assignments require using skills that you have already covered in these materials.

- Avoid making changes to the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID (e.g., avoid deleting backticks, changing code chunk names, not using the file provided).

- Try to use the code that we teach in the book.

- Read the question carefully and ensure that you provide exactly what is asked for (e.g., code or a single value). Do not deviate from what the question asks. You are more than encouraged to practice different approaches in your own time, but for the assignments you should only do what the questions ask.

- Follow the instructions for how to fill out the .Rmd file carefully making sure you do not change anything in the file you shouldn’t.

- Please pay special attention if the question asks for a specific output, e.g. *value* or a *tibble*/*data_frame*; when asked for a *value* as an output, make sure it is a single value and not a value stored in a tibble. Finally, when altering code inside the code blocks, *do not* re-order, rename, or remove the code blocks (e.g. T01, 0T2, ... etc.). If you do, this will impact your grade and may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment! If you are unsure about any of these points, ask a member of staff.

- Test that the .Rmd file you are submitting is reproducible, after completing it, by "knitting" it as an html file. This also shows what you've accomplished and allows you to spot potential errors. If your code does not knit, this may result in you receiving an H grade for this assignment.

- A great test of your code is to close R Studio, restart it, open and knit your code, see that it runs, and go through it to make sure it is correct. This will test whether you have remembered to include essential elements, such as libraries, in your code. This does not mean that your code is correct, however, it simply means that your code runs. You need to check the output and compare to the question to see that it matches.

- When loading in data, you must use a relative path as opposed to an absolute path.  Relative would mean having the datafile in the same folder as the .Rmd file and just calling the datafile when reading it in, e.g. `read_csv("data.csv")`. Absolute would be using a path specific to the folder structure of your computer, e.g. `read_csv("C:/PhilsComputer/PhilsFolder/data.csv")`. Only use relative paths and under no circumstances should you rename the datafile from the one we tell you to use. Note that “data.csv” is a different name from “data (1).csv” and different from “data_1.csv”. Only use the name we give you.

- The following functions are considered forbidden and must not appear anywhere in your code at all.  Inclusion of them in your code may result in you receiving no marks for the assignment. The functions are: `install.packages()`, `help()`, `vignette()`, `setwd()`,`help.start()`, or `View()`.

- Read the feedback you are given!

- Collate your notes and learn from your mistakes. These assignments are weighted low in order to allow you the space to make mistakes and to not have a major impact on your overall course grade. It is imperative that you take this opportunity. 

- Refer back all the time to what you have done previously. The skills stay the same; only the data changes.

### Common Mistakes

- Changing the .Rmd file other than to provide answers and your GUID.

- Changing the name of the datafile to something other than the one we provide – e.g. “data.csv” and “data (1).csv” are two different files.

- Using code that is very different to that taught in the book. We will check any incorrect answers and if you have used different code that produces what is asked you will still get the mark, however, using different code from the book increases the risk that you will produce a different output to the one intended. 

- Failure to follow instructions (e.g., writing code when a single value was requested).

- Including any illegal code in your .Rmd file, e.g., install.packages (you should never write code that would change something on someone else’s machine, it causes issues and it’s impolite!). 
- We always ask students to use the function `read_csv()` to load in data yet students often use `read.csv()`. There is a difference between the output these create so always do what the questions ask.

- Be very careful with spelling. For example, UK is not the same as Uk. Do what the questions ask.

- Never do more than what the question asks. We check the output of a task to see that it matches what we expect. If it does not match what we expect then it is wrong. Remember the point is about being reproducible and replicable. Think of this in terms of you are sending your good to a colleague who expects a certain thing, and if your code works differently then that is not good practice.

- Try things out in the console and in your own scripts but only put your final answers in the .Rmd.

- Failing to read your feedback from previous assignments.

- Failing to check that your code knits before submitting it.

- Failing to check that you are submitting the right file. Only one submission is allowed per lab.

### How is the assessment related to the lectures for this course?

These practical data assignments assess your ability to wrangle and visualise data in an open and reproducible way, to interpret and work with data, to understand analysis and research methods, and to present studies in a professional manner, as discussed in the lecture series. Whilst these assignments are of course most closely related to the Research Methods and Statistics lectures, understanding data and analysis will help with your critical evaluation of research in all fields of Psychology. By understanding where the results come from will give you a much deeper approach to critically assessing the claims of the research.

### Why am I being assessed like this?

The practical skills taught through these assignments are very important for psychological researchers to develop in order to understand analysis, methods, and research. Your skills will progress throughout your degree, but the best approach to developing these skills is through regular continuous assessment. Much like learning a language, more practice over a longer period of time will give you better results than cramming at the last minute. Continual regular practice is better than one big chunk. As such, these assignments ensure that you are maintaining a steady and solid rate of progress. 

### How does this relate to previous work I have completed?

- The individual and generic feedback from previous assignments, and solutions for these assignments will help you complete these assignments. In addition, the data skills book activities will really help you in completing these assignments. You should not overlook the importance of these formative tasks.

- Don't forget that asking questions on the forums or speaking with GTAs and team members in labs is also giving you feedback and feedforward and will help you complete this assessment.
