<span class="header-section-number">17</span> Structure of the Method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#method-section"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h1>
<p>The method section is normally split into a series of subsections, each detailing different aspects of how you went about running your study. For your report, we recommend using the following subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants</p></li>
<li><p>Materials</p></li>
<li><p>Procedure</p></li>
<li><p>Design and Data Analysis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As you read more journal articles, you might notice some additional sub-sections, a different order of presentation, or merging some of these sections into one. However, we encourage you to start by learning this method, so you can recognise the key information that should be included in the method section.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you are writing a registered report, so there will be some details you will not know that you see included in a traditional report. For example, you will not know the final sample size, nor will you know precisely how you analysed the data. You can only report how you designed the study to constrain researcher degrees of freedom, not what the end product is.</p>
<p>One element that might feel a little odd is you write the method section in past tense - describing how you <em>planned</em> your study - even when you have not conducted it yet. We do this as a published final registered report includes all the sections with the method and results in the middle, so it is presented as one longer piece of work for how you designed your study and then what results you found. We are retaining the style, even though you will submit the stage one and stage two report separately.</p>
<p>As we work through the sections, try and identify all the different decisions you and your group will need to make. Ask yourself whether you know the information yet, or whether its something you still need to find out. Then, consider how you will justify the decision using supporting evidence where applicable.</p>
<div id="participants" class="section level2" number="17.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">17.1</span> Participants<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#participants"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Normally, this would appear first in the method and what you are trying to show is who were the people that took part in your study. You would normally include aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Method of recruitment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opportunity/convenience, volunteer, or random sampling?</p></li>
<li><p>How were they encouraged to take part? Was there any incentive?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant demographic information</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is relevant depends on what you are testing. This is about contextualising your sample to the reader.</p></li>
<li><p>So, we tend to give an overall description of the sample and then we give a description relevant to what we are testing. However, if you are not testing any groups then you might not need this and you just need the overall view.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it is not necessary to go into lots of detail about nationality and other demographics if you are not testing that demographic and do not think it is relevant to the outcome of your study.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any inclusion or exclusion criteria</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inclusion criteria are features you are looking for in your sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclusion criteria are features that you would exclude people from your sample.</p></li>
<li><p>These are not necessarily opposites, think of it as inclusion criteria are what would get people into your sample, and exclusion criteria are what would remove people from your sample.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the order that you present information within a section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember you are leading a reader through the methods, so it is important for them to be able to follow what you are saying. This means thinking about what they will know at certain points and what they will understand. Ask yourself, "will this make sense to a reader if I present this information now, or should I present it later/earlier?"</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if you plan on excluding people and this changes the possible demographics of your groups, then it would make sense to present the demographics after you have presented the exclusion criteria - so it is clear the demographics are of those left in your study and do not include people you plan on removing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="materials" class="section level2" number="17.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Materials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#materials"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This would normally come second in your method section and it is really about the software and questionnaires in this study, or about the stimuli, questionnaire, software, and/or additional materials used more generally. Assume the reader knows nothing about the questionnaires and software here and you are trying to convey information about the materials to them so they can understand what they are and how they were used.</p>
<p>A well-written materials section should allow someone who was not part of the research team to replicate the study. You are trying to give them as much detail as possible that they could run your study, but sometimes longer details (such as a full list of questions) can be included in the appendix to save space in the main report.</p>
<p>You would normally include aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demographic questions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How many questions were there?</p></li>
<li><p>What were the response options?</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a question or two. It does not have to detail every question but can summarise the main points.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "We used a series of {state number} demographic questionnaires to establish age, nationality... with dropdown categorical options to respond to ... and free-response boxes to answer.."</p></li>
<li><p>Again, think about what is relevant. Focus on detailing the demographics you are using for the analysis. If you are not using a demographic variable, then keep this just as a broad overview of the demographics part and maybe just detail age and gender questions as you need them for in the participants section.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You should describe the full MSLQ and state which subscale/s you will use data from.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not have to list all the subscales but give an overview of the general purpose of the questionnaire and then focus on the subscale(s) you are using. It can be useful to reiterate what the subscale(s) mean here.</p></li>
<li><p>The MSLQ should have a formal citation (available in the MSLQ overview document)</p></li>
<li><p>State aspects such as how many questions there were in total and how many questions are in your relevant subscale/s</p></li>
<li><p>What were the response options on the subscale/s?</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "The help-seeking subscale is made up of 5 questions such as "example question" and "example question", with potential responses on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 means .. and 5 means.."</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should also cite the software used to host the questionnaire</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example: "The study was hosted on Experimentum (DeBruine et al., 2020)"</p></li>
<li><p>DeBruine, L., Lai, R., Jones, B., Abdullah, R., &amp; Mahrholz, G. (2020). Experimentum (Version v.0.2). Zenodo. <a href="doi:10.5281/zenodo.2634355" class="uri">doi:10.5281/zenodo.2634355</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level2" number="17.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">17.3</span> Procedure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#procedure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The procedure details what happened in the study. This section normally comes after the materials section as the reader needs to understand <strong>what</strong> you used before they can understand <strong>how</strong> you used it. It can take a while to recognise the distinction between the two sections as you are trying to avoid overlap between the sections, but consider the materials as what participants completed, and the procedure as when in the study they completed each element of the materials.</p>
<p>The main point to keep in mind when writing this section is to think about reproducibility. After reading this sub-section, a reader should be able to reproduce your study exactly, based on what you have written in the materials and procedure.</p>
<p>The procedure is often written as one paragraph, but it does not necessarily need to be if it makes more sense to break things up. However, try and avoid using one sentence paragraphs or presenting it as bullet points.</p>
<p>You would normally include aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What the participants did in the study, what order they did things in, how the study looked to them, and how long they took overall.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to think about how the participant accessed the study. It can help to go back and run the study on yourself again and think about the different things that you do in the study.</p></li>
<li><p>This is where you outline the ethics processes, such as reading the information sheet and providing consent at the start, and reading the debrief at the end. You do not need to explain what information these documents contain, just when they read them and how they interacted with them.</p></li>
<li><p>You can include the color of font and background color.</p></li>
<li><p>You would normally state what order participants did things in: did they do the demographics and then the MSLQ, or vice versa?</p></li>
<li><p>Try to state how the questions were presented and whether they were randomised or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to state if all the questions were on the same screen or was it one question on the screen at any one time?</p></li>
<li><p>Try to state how participants responded: did they use the mouse, did they use certain keys, did they speak their answer?</p></li>
<li><p>Did participants have a time duration to respond by or was it untimed, and what did they do if they did not want to respond to a question?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you find you are repeating a lot of information from the materials, then there is a good chance you are mixing up what information goes where. Remember: the procedure is about what participants saw and did, and how the study was presented to them. The main goal here is to find a balance between providing enough detail for someone to replicate your study, and avoiding surplus detail that is not that directly relevant.</p>
<p>For example: "<em>Participants saw an advert on social media and then they clicked on the link and then they read the consent form and then if they decided they wanted to do the study they consented and then they started answering the questions</em>" can be reduced to: "<em>Participants accessed the study through a link on social media. Before starting the study, participants read an information sheet and gave consent to taking part.</em>"</p>
</div>
<div id="design-and-data-analysis" class="section level2" number="17.4">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">17.4</span> Design and Data Analysis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#design-and-data-analysis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This subsection usually comes last in the method because it is now leading the reader into the results. It is the transition point between how the study was run and what you used into how you plan on analysing the data. It is not about the procedure as it is not about what your participants saw or did, it is about what <strong>you</strong> plan on doing with the data.</p>
<p>Thinking about logical flow again, if you were to present this at the start of the method section, then it would not make much sense to the reader as they just do not know enough information about the study yet.</p>
<p>You would normally include aspects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify the research design of your study</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is it within-subjects, between-subjects, correlational?</p></li>
<li><p>If you have more than one analysis in your study, you must remember to discuss and present both - either as one paragraph or two separate paragraphs.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the dependent/measured variables</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are planning a t-test then it would be better to talk about your dependent variable</p></li>
<li><p>If you are planning a correlation, then it would be better to talk about measured variables as there is no independent and dependent variable in a correlational design.</p></li>
<li><p>Be precise: you are testing the mean or sum score on a subscale of the MSLQ, it is not just e.g., self-efficacy as an abstract concept.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the independent variable and its conditions/levels (levels is just another name for conditions or groups), if you have one (i.e., those using a t-test)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can clarify it is a quasi-experimental variable.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "In our study, we have an independent variable of level of study with two levels: postgraduate and undergraduate.</p></li>
<li><p>Your levels will potentially link back to information in the participants section if you have an independent variable. Remember though: if you have a correlational design, you probably will not have one.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, you could report a power analysis here to outline how many participants you estimate you need to detect your smallest effect size of interest. Alternatively, you could report it at the start of your results section. If you and your group do attempt a power analysis, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will want to state and justify the alpha value, the power value, and the smallest effect size of interest. Typically, you will be calculating the sample size as the output here.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: "Previous research (Paterson &amp; Robertson, 2014; Swingler &amp; Toivo, 2019; Toivo &amp; Swingler, 2020) found small- to medium-sized correlations in related studies looking at test anxiety and help-seeking. As such, using the field standard of alpha = .05, power = .80, and a smallest effect size of interest of <em>r</em> = .3 (Swingler &amp; Toivo, 2019), we require 35 participants.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Briefly state how you plan on analysing the data</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You would state the type of test, use of R (with citations), and any relevant packages.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea here is to constrain those researcher degrees of freedom, so you are outlining how you plan on analysing the data to the best of your knowledge, so you can explain and justify any deviations from this plan in your stage two individual report.</p></li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Methods sections are formulaic and work by putting the right information in the right sections. Try to follow the guidance above on what goes where.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>must</strong> use sub-headings and we would highly recommend the sub-headings we have stated here.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to avoid repeating information across sections. If you find you are doing that, then it is likely that you are including information in the wrong sections. Each section has a different focus.</p></li>
<li><p>Be concise but detailed. Try not to waste words in the method section and state things clearly. Save words for building your narrative in the introduction and discussion sections. Its a balancing act as your method section should also be detailed enough to allow someone to replicate your study.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading journal articles and focusing on the method section is a good way to see what information can go where. There is a lot of variation in published articles though and they are not often replicable, so another thing to think about when reading papers is "what is missing here that would allow me to replicate this study?".</p></li>
<li><p>Read the ILOs in the Assessment Information Sheet (AIS) for aspects about demonstrating technical knowledge of the different parts, for writing clearly and succinctly, and for professional communication and organisation.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>"The experiment took place in the experimental laboratories of the University of Glasgow. Participants were required to complete a 2AFC task during which they listened to pairs of voices comprising high- and low-pitched versions of the original recordings. The sound samples were presented through headphones (participants' own) connected to a computer with the sound set at approximately 80 dB Sound Pressure Level (SPL): System volume was measured prior to the experiment using a standard headphone set (Sennheisser Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 250 OHM) and sound meter. At the beginning of the experiment, participants were informed, via on-screen instructions, that they would hear pairs of voices in two blocks, by trait, and would be asked to make a decision regarding each pair. Participants were told that there was no time limit to their decision but were encouraged to answer with their first impression. After each pair of voices the question "Which voice did you perceive as more {dominant} {trustworthy}?" was displayed on the screen. Pressing the "s" key would mean that they perceived Voice 1 as being most dominant or trustworthy, whereas the "k" key represented Voice 2. The definitions of dominance and trustworthiness used in the instructions were "Dominance means having power and influence over others" and "Trustworthiness means able to be relied on as honest or truthful." The order of the dominance and trustworthiness blocks, as well as the order in which the voice trials were presented within the block, were counterbalanced across participants. Male and female trials were presented randomly within the same block, as opposed to being presented in different blocks, to avoid an additional potential block-order effect caused by the gender of the voice. Finally, the order of the high- and low-pitched versions of the recordings within each trial was counterbalanced by including two trials of each pair in a block, with the high- and low-pitched versions in a different order. Therefore, within each block, the 20 pairs of voice samples were presented twice. The voices within each pair were played consecutively with a 1-s pause between the first voice and the second voice, and participants proceeded to the next trial by pressing "space." The experiment lasted approximately 14 min."</p>

<p>"After each pair of voices the question "Which voice did you perceive as more {dominant} {trustworthy}?" was displayed on the screen. Pressing the "s" key would mean that they perceived Voice 1 as being most dominant or trustworthy, whereas the "k" key represented Voice 2."</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This is clear on which keys participants were told to use. This is quite specific detail, but clearly the authors had a reason for this. Normally, this will be because it helps reduce reaction times if specific keys are used and participants hold their fingers on those keys at all times.</p></li>
<li><p>However, what is not stated is whether participants were told to always have fingers on those keys and whether this "key-mapping" (what key represents what answer) was shown all the time to participants, just at the start, or just at breaks?</p></li>

<p>This is adapted from the materials section of a first draft of a paper by Stuart McLaren and Phil McAleer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; Cruise et al., 1985) consists of 51 items comprised of two sections and six subscales. The first section includes 23 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from "1 = No Anxiety" to "5 = Strong Anxiety". This section addresses three factors related to how individuals experience specific statistical situations: (a) Test and Class Anxiety (8-items with scores that range from 8 to 40), (b) Interpretation Anxiety (11-items with scores that range from 11 to 55) and (c) Fear of Asking for Help (4-items with scores that range from 4 to 20). For instance, statements include "Doing an examination for a statistics course" or "Going to ask my statistics teacher for individual help with material I am having difficulty in understanding". The second section consists of 28 statements rated on a 5-point Likert scale that range from "1 = Strongly Disagree" to "5 = Strongly Agree". This section examines levels of attitudes towards scenarios that involve statistics and statistics teachers over three factors: (d) Worth of Statistics (16-items with scores that range from 16 to 80), (e) Fear of Statistic Teachers (5-items with scores that range from 5 to 25), and (f) Computational Self-Concept (7-items with scores that range from 7 to 35). For example, statements include "I wish the statistics requirement would be removed from my academic program" or "Statisticians are more number orientated than they are people orientated". A compound score of each subscale is calculated by summing item scores in each subscale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of statistics anxiety. The six subscales show good Cronbach's alpha reliabilities between .81 and .94 (Chew et al., 2018)."</p>

<li>Note here that we are talking about the scales: what it looked liked and specifically not how the participants responded. Think about what information goes where at all times.

<ul>
<li>This works here, but it could also appear in the data analysis subsection. The idea is that by the time you get to the results, you know what is happening with the scales and how they are calculated and interpreted.

<ul>
<li>Finally, we have not explored reliability of scales in much detail (briefly in lecture 2) but if you had that information from a previous paper, then it can be useful and helps give context to the scales to show they are valid and reliable. The one thing maybe here that is missing is just stating what these values mean: for example, do they mean high reliability or low reliability? It could be extended by "The six subscales show good Cronbach's alpha reliabilities between .81 and .94 (Chew et al., 2018) meaning that...".</li>
